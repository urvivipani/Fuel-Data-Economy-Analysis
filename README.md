# Fuel-Data-Economy-Analysis


What is Fuel Economy?
The fuel economy of an automobile is the fuel efficiency relationship between the distance traveled and the amount of fuel consumed by the vehicle. Consumption can be expressed in terms of volume of fuel to travel a distance, or the distance travelled per unit volume of fuel consumed.

      ===================================================

Up to the 1985 model year, fuel economy guides were generated
separately for 49-state and California.

DEFINITION OF REPORT ABBREVIATIONS
ŒAn explanation of abbreviations used in the Fuel Economy Guide 
and Test Car List reports published by EPA follows:
